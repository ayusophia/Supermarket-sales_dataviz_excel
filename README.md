# Supermarket-sales_dataviz_excel
I'm creating a dynamic Excel sales dashboard based on supermarket sales data. The dashboard will showcase key parameters such as Sales Period, Sales Amount, Types of Product Lines Sold, Average Rating per City, and Payment Methods.

To enhance user experience and enable further analysis, i've incorporated clickable slicers that allow for easy filtering and querying of the data.
